#' Send an email message through SMTP
#'
#' Send an email message to one or more recipients via an SMTP server. The email
#' message required as input to `smtp_send()` has to be created by using the
#' [compose_email()] function. The `email_message` object can be previewed by
#' printing the object, where the HTML preview will show how the message should
#' appear in recipients' email clients. We can avoid re-entering SMTP
#' configuration and credentials information by retrieving this information
#' either from disk (with the file generated by use of the
#' [create_smtp_creds_file()] function), or, from the system's key-value store
#' (with the key set by the [create_smtp_creds_key()] function).
#'
#' To send messages, we need access to the **mailsend-go** binary, which is
#' cross-platform and works on Windows, macOS (via Homebrew), and Linux (Debian
#' and RPM packages). Instructions for installation can be found at the
#' [blastula website](https://rich-iannone.github.io/blastula/).
#'
#' @param email The email message object, as created by the [compose_email()]
#'   function. The object's class is `email_message`.
#' @param to A vector of email addresses serving as primary recipients for the
#'   message. For secondary recipients, use the `cc` and `bcc` arguments.
#' @param from The email address of the sender. Often this needs to be the same
#'   email address that is associated with the account actually sending the
#'   message.
#' @param subject The subject of the message, which is usually a brief summary
#'   of the topic of the message.
#' @param cc A vector of email addresses for sending the message as a carbon
#'   copy. This list of for those who are to receive a copy of a message
#'   addressed primarily to another. The list of recipients in the CC list is
#'   visible to all other recipients of the message.
#' @param bcc A vector of email addresses for sending the message as blind
#'   carbon copies. Any email addresses provided here will receive the message
#'   and these email addresses will be concealed from other recipients
#'   (including others on the BCC list).
#' @param credentials One of three credential helper functions must be used
#'   here: (1) [creds()], (2) [creds_key()], or (3) [creds_file()]. The first,
#'   [creds()], allows for a manual specification of SMTP configuration and
#'   credentials within that helper function. This is the most secure method for
#'   supplying credentials as they aren't written to disk. The [creds_key()]
#'   function is used if credentials are stored in the system-wide key-value
#'   store, through use of the [create_smtp_creds_key()] function. The
#'   [creds_file()] helper function relies on a credentials file stored on disk.
#'   Such a file is created using the [create_smtp_creds_file()] function.
#' @param binary_loc An option to supply the location of the `mailsend-go`
#'   binary file should it not be on the system path or in the working
#'   directory.
#' @param echo If set to `TRUE`, the command for sending the message via
#'   `mailsend-go` will be printed to the console. By default, this is `FALSE`.
#' @param dry_run Setting `dry_run` to `TRUE` will return information on the
#'   SMTP sending options. Furthermore, the function will stop short of actually
#'   sending the email message out. By default, however, this is set to `FALSE`.
#' @param creds_file An option to specify a credentials file. As this argument
#'   is deprecated, please consider using `credentials = creds_file(<file>)`
#'   instead.

#' \dontrun{
#' # Before sending out an email through
#' # SMTP, we need an `email_message`
